Haneke+AFNetworking
===================

> Haneke and AFNetworking,<br>
> sitting in a tree...

A zero-config Haneke extension to use [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) for image downloads. 

##Installation

Using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/):

```ruby
pod 'Haneke+AFNetworking', '~> 0.2'
```

Alternatively, you can simply add the files from the [Haneke+AFNetworking](https://github.com/Haneke/Haneke-AFNetworking/tree/master/Haneke%2BAFNetworking) directory to your project (after adding Haneke itself).

## Usage

Like [Haneke](https://github.com/Haneke/Haneke), using this extension requires no configuration. Simply import `Haneke+AFNetworking.h` instead of `Haneke.h`.
