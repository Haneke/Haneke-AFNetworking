Haneke+AFNetworking
===================

> Haneke and AFNetworking,<br>
> sitting in a tree...


Haneke extension to use [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) for downloads. 

Uses [Haneke 1.0.0](https://github.com/hpique/Haneke/tree/v1.0) which isn't officially out yet.

### Usage

Like Haneke itself, using this extension requires no configuration. Simply import `Haneke+AFNetworking.h` instead of `Haneke.h`.
